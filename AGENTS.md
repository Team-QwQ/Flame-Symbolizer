## Project Structure

- `src/` - 主要源代码目录
- `doc/` - 过程文档存放
- `specs/` - 规范文档，见下方Stage-Gated Workflow (spec/plan/do)章节
- `plans/` - 计划文档，见下方Stage-Gated Workflow (spec/plan/do)章节
- `src/ref/` - 此文件夹下存放示例代码，非本项目代码，仅供参考

## Coding Conventions

- 程序需具备良好的可读性，易于理解
- 程序需具备良好的可维护性，易于扩展
- 程序需具备良好的健壮性，能处理异常情况
- 文档使用中文输出，流程图(比如UML的状态机图、通信图、顺序图)优先使用mermaid语法绘制

## Stage-Gated Workflow (spec/plan/do)

- Mode: Opt-in. The workflow applies only when the user explicitly uses `/spec`, `/plan`, or `/do`. Routine Q&A or trivial edits do not require these stages.
- Triggers: A message containing one of `/spec`, `/plan`, or `/do` activates or advances the workflow. Once active, stages must proceed in order with explicit user approval to advance.
- Guardrails:
  - Do not modify source code before `/do`. Documentation/spec files may be edited only in `/spec`.
  - Do not skip stages or proceed without user confirmation once the workflow is active.
  - If scope changes, return to the appropriate prior stage for approval.
  - Respect sandbox/approval settings for all actions.

- When to Use
  - Use the workflow for new features, structural refactors, multi-file changes, or work needing traceability.
  - Skip the workflow (no triggers) for routine Q&A, diagnostics, or one-off trivial edits.

- Entry Points and Prerequisites
  - `/spec` is the canonical entry point for new efforts.
  - `/plan` requires an approved `/spec`. If unclear which spec applies, pause and ask the user to identify the correct file(s) under `specs/`.
  - `/do` requires an approved `/plan`.

- `/spec` (Specifications; docs only)
  - Purpose: Capture a concrete, reviewable specification using spec-kit style.
  - Output: Markdown spec(s) under `specs/` (no code changes). Share a concise diff summary and links to updated files; wait for approval.
  - Style: Specs are canonical and final. Do not include change logs or “correction/更正” notes. Incorporate revisions directly so the document always reflects the current agreed state. Historical context belongs in PR descriptions, commit messages, or the conversation — not in the spec.
  - Recommended contents:
    - Problem statement and context
    - Goals and non-goals
    - Requirements and constraints (functional, UX, performance, security)
    - UX/flows and API/IPC contracts (as applicable)
    - Acceptance criteria and success metrics
    - Alternatives considered and open questions
    - Rollout/backout considerations and telemetry (if relevant)

- `/plan` (High-level Plan; docs only)
  - Purpose: Turn the approved spec into an ordered, verifiable implementation plan.
  - Inputs: Approved spec file(s) in `specs/`.
  - Ambiguity: If the relevant spec is unclear, pause and request clarification before writing the plan.
  - Style: Plans are canonical and should not include change logs or “correction/更正” notes. Incorporate revisions directly so the plan always reflects the current agreed state. Historical notes should live in PR descriptions, commit messages, or the conversation.
  - Output:
    - An ordered plan via `update_plan` (short, verifiable steps; Task is merged into Plan and tracked here).
    - A plan document in `plans/` named `YYYY-MM-DD-short-title.md`, containing:
      - Scope and links to authoritative spec(s)
      - Assumptions and out-of-scope items
      - Phases/milestones mapped to acceptance criteria
      - Impacted areas, dependencies, risks/mitigations
      - Validation strategy (tests/lint/build) and rollout/backout notes
      - Approval status and next stage
  - Handoff: Await user approval of the plan before `/do`.

- `/do` (Execution)
  - Purpose: Implement approved plan steps with minimal, focused changes and file operations.
  - Actions:
    - Use `apply_patch` for file edits; group related changes and keep diffs scoped to approved steps.
    - Provide concise progress updates and a final summary of changes.
    - Validate appropriately: run some relevant tests.
    - If material changes to the plan are needed, pause and return to `/plan` (or `/spec`) for approval.
  - Output: Implemented changes, validation results, and a concise change summary linked to the plan checklist.

### Plans Directory

- Location: `plans/` at the repository root.
- Filename: `YYYY-MM-DD-short-title.md` (kebab-case title; consistent dating).
- Style: Plan docs are the canonical source of truth for the implementation approach; avoid embedding change logs or “correction/更正” notes. Update the plan in place as decisions evolve.
- Contents:
  - Title and summary
  - Scope and linked specs (paths under `specs/`)
  - Assumptions / Out of scope
  - Step-by-step plan (short, verifiable)
  - Validation strategy (tests/lint/build)
  - Approval status and next stage
- Process:
  - During `/plan`, create or update the relevant file in `plans/` and share a short summary in the conversation. Await approval before `/do`.
